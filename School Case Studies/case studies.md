Question 1: Clustering and PCA for wine
=======================================

The data contains information on 11 chemical properties of 6500
different bottles of vinho verde wine from northern Portugal. In this
question, we try to use two dimensionality reduction techniques
(Clustering and PCA) to distinguish wine color and wine quality. Write a
summary of how well each technique performes and what results we find.

***Our Steps***

Clustering Method

1.  use 2 clusters first for color use 7 clusters first for quality

2.  results

PCA Method

1.  apply PCA on the data set

2.  repeat clustering on reduced dimensions

3.  results

***Clustering***

*Color*

We start by using clustering method. Since we want to explore whether
clustering method can distinguish between reds and whites as well as
different levels of quality, we remove the color and quality columns,
and rescale other variables to do unsupervised analysis.

Here, we deploy 2 centers, to measure how well clustering is able to
distinguish between whites and reds (preferably reds cluster and whites
cluster).

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-4-2.png)

    ##                          wine1$color
    ## cluster_2_centers$cluster  red white
    ##                         1   24  4830
    ##                         2 1575    68

The plots demonstrate that for each cluster, the points identified in
clusters overlap well with actual color. This is backed up by the
confusion matrix, the accuracy rate is 0.9858396. Therefore, we can say
that Clustering Method is capable of distinguishing the reds from the
whites using 2 centers with chemical properties.

*Quality*

![](case%20studies%20pic/quality_distribution-1.png)

Next for quality, we intend to use 10 centers, corresponding to 1-10 of
wine quality. However, since we observe that there are no 1,2 and 10
category for wine quality, it makes more sense to try 7 different
clusters corresponding to quality from 3-9.

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

    ##                          wine$quality
    ## cluster_7_centers$cluster   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
    ##                         1   4  21  77 548 446  97   4
    ##                         2   5  64 446 549 137  27   1
    ##                         3   7  63 471 350  43   2   0
    ##                         4   1   2  20   9   1   0   0
    ##                         5   2  27 269 475 189  31   0
    ##                         6   7  24 655 640 122  22   0
    ##                         7   4  15 200 265 141  14   0

From the table, we can tell that each cluster has different quality
levels of wine. Even some cluster has mainly a certain level of quality
wine, still it cannot distinguish from 7 levels of wine in an accurate
way. So, clustering method is not capable of sorting the higher from the
lower quality wines.

***PCA***

We wish to visulaize 6500 observations with measurements on a set of 11
features, fixed. acidity, volatile.acidity, citric.acid, etc. We could
do this by examining two-dimensional scatterplots of the data, each of
which contains the 6500 observations’ measurements on two of the 11
features. However, there are $11\*\\frac{11-1}{2} = 55$ such
scatterplots (pick 2 among 11 features). PCA provides a tool to find a
low-dimensional representation of a data set that contains as much as
possible of the variation and captures as much as the information as
possible.

Specifically here, our goal here is to use PCA to reduce noise and find
the most important several properties which can help us clearly
distinguish between reds and whites, as well as different quality levels
of wine.

First and foremost, we seek for the most important components which have
highest proportion of variance among 11 features, as well as draw a
graph of the PC from highest variance to the lowest variance. We find
that PC1 and PC2 are the most important two features with variance of
0.2754 and 0.2267 respectively.

We also choose K=2 (the same as above Clustering Method). From the
following graph, we can see PCA does well in distinguishing reds from
whites. The plot shows two clear clusters separating reds from whites
with only very few overlap.

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

With 0.9836848 &lt; 0.9858396, reduce dimensions before clustering to
distinguish between whites and reds is worse than simple K-mean
clustering.

Move on to attempt at distinguish wine quality, first we conduct PCA on
rescaled wine data.

Similar to simple K-mean clustering, PCA does not perform well in
distinguishing wines with different quality levels. The graph is blurry.
Different quality levels of wine center in the same area with the
similar component 1/component 2 variance.

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

Next, we apply PCA before trying to conduct a 7 cluster. However, as the
graph below represents, it does not help us to distinguish between
different quality of wine much better than just PCA. Again, we can look
at the confusion matrix for PCA K-mean cluster for wine quality.

    ##                  wine$quality
    ## clustPCA2$cluster   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
    ##                 1   6  21 491 482  95  17   0
    ##                 2   4   5  91 122  55   6   0
    ##                 3   5  53 303 565 233  44   0
    ##                 4   2  22 137 541 428  93   4
    ##                 5   0  23 299 257  97   7   0
    ##                 6   7  53 329 264  36   2   0
    ##                 7   6  39 488 605 135  24   1

As we can see, the clusters misidentified many observations, making it
ill-suited to predict wine quality.

***Conclusion***

Clustering method is capable of distinguishing between red wine and
white wine, even without applying PCA to reduce noise from 11 chemical
properties.

However, Clustering method is incapable of distinguishing amongst
different wine quality since the quality distribution is centered
heavily around 5 and 6, making it hard to create 7 clusters to
differentiate the quality. The optimal k we found to be 3, which further
support this argument.

Question 2: Market segmentation
===============================

Report
------

***Goal***

We want to use Clustering Method and PCA Method to indentify some
interesting market segments and provide some insights about how to
assist NutrientH2O in understanding its social-media audience better, so
that they can hone the messaging more sharply to tagert followers.

***Pre-process the Data***

We firstly should clean the data a bit. Some columns should be omitted
since they have a high tendency to distort the model we build. As far as
we are concerned, we choose to ignore these categories: Chatter, Spam,
Adult and Uncategorized since we suppose they are useless and
inappropriate.

***Overview the Data***

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)

We can get a rough sense of the whole data set a bit. Photo Sharing and
Health Nutrition are the most popular topics for tweets. Apart from
allocating the marketing resources tow these two categories, we should
not ignore other potential topics which can be explored more. As we can
see from the graph, there is a wide range of the other tweets topics
from cooking (at approximately 5.5%) to art (at approximately 2%) among
followers. We need to try to broaden the marketing to more topics of
these. Therefore, we should use Clustering Method to group similar
followers and their tweets to better utilize interesting marketing
segments for product promotion.

***Clustering Method***

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)

We would like to find an optimal K to do the clustering. By using CH
Index, we can see that K=2 has a max CH. However, we feel that 2
clusters are not enough to make an analysis for the tweets features. We
try to use K=6, which seems to be an elbow in this graph, to explore
deeper.

Let's try K=6.

NOTE: Since each time K means Clustering would cluster differently, we
cannot make a complete corresponding analysis to the graph we produce.
Here, we only summarize our insights and give suggestions based on the
graph result we ran for a typical one time.

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)

**Cluster 1 Young Adults Before Marriage**

*Insights*

Cluster 1 is related to dating, current events, art, shopping and
television/film. It is kind of hard to tell which group has these
features. We assume it to be Young Adults Before Marriage. They like to
date since they haven't been married. They are excited about current
events, art, shopping and also tv/film stuff.

*Suggestions*

We would suggest NutrientH2O to do something realted to social
relationship. Just like the app Bumble, it offers a platform to let
youngsters make online friends/date with people of same interests.

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)

**Cluster 2 Working Professionals**

*Insights*

Cluster 2 is related to automotive, computers, travel, news and
politics. We presume this cluster is mainly for Working Professionals.
They incline to travel a lot for work (such as big 4 auditing
department), be fond of high tech, and pay much attention to daily news
and politics.

*Suggestions*

We would suggest NutrientH2O to pay more attention to broadcast
up-to-date news related to cars, computers, travel information and
politics. These topics of news will surely be eye-catching for those
working professionals.

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)

**Cluster 3 Fashion Chasers**

*Insights*

Cluster 3 is related to music, photo\_sharing, beauty, fashion and
cooking. Obviously, this cluster should be classfied as Fashion Chasers.
They care much about the fashionable trends. We bet that they use social
media a lot to post pohtos related to music, beauty, cooking, etc.

*Suggestions*

We would suggest NutrientH2O to develop their products and service
deeper about social media area. For example, NutrientH2O can hold some
online competition about retweets and posts to reward people whose
instagram posts have the highest number of sharings.

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)

**Cluster 4 Typical Moms**

*Insights*

Cluster 4 is related to school, food, sports fandom, parenting and
religion. We can see that this cluster represents the the typical mom,
tweeting about things about school, food, sports, parenting, and
religion. They spend lots of time volunteering at their kids' schools,
involving their kids' sports activities as well as going to church every
weekend.

*Suggestions*

We would suggest NutrientH2O to devote their time and energy to those
moms who account for a large part of middle-aged parents with lots of
spending power. NutrientH2O should definitely focus significant energy
and marketing dollars on this group, doing something not only related to
their kids but also some things tailored to their features. For
instance, NutrientH2O can develop a certain product which can be a
leisure entertainment for those moms when they are waiting for kids from
school.

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png)

**Cluster 5 Young Students**

*Insights*

Cluster 5 is related to music, television/film, sports, online games and
college/univeristy. Obviously, this cluster is mainly regarded as young
students who attend schools and love to listen to music, watch films,
play sports and online games.

*Suggestions*

We would suggest NutrientH2O to pay more attention to offering popular
music(not classical since we suppose youngsters prefer K-pop, rap, etc),
films related to nowadays trends, sports which are more bloody and
firece (not super slow pace or relaxing sports which are tailored to the
old), online games which have more visual effects since youngsters love
reckless competitions.

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)

**Cluster 6 Fit Generation**

*Insights*

Cluster 6 is related to food, eco, outdoors, personal fitness and health
nutrition. We can speculate that this cluster is mainly regarded as a
Fit Generation. Those people focus on a balanced lifestyle by eating
healthy and nutritious food, participating outdoor activities, doing
atheletic sports, etc.

*Suggestions*

We would suggest NutrientH2O to advertise more eco-friendly, healthy and
nutritious products which are attracted by those people.

***PCA Method***

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png)

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png)
![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-26-2.png)

![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-26-5.png)
![](case%20studies%20pic/unnamed-chunk-26-6.png)

We pick up the first two most importants components to make further
analysis. These six plots show six groups we indentified when we use
Clustering Method into PCA two-domention result. A plot represent a
twitter user, and the more red it is, the more percentage of the user's
posts relate to the corresponding group.

In other words, the more red the graph is, we can suppose that more
users are in the each hypothetical group we have defined. So
specifically here, relatively, there are more red dots in the graph of
"Fit Generation", "Fashion Chasers" and "Young Studnets". Hence, we can
say that these groups are clustered in a relatively more precise way.

***Conclusion***

The main insights and suggestions are discussed above each cluster and
PCA. Here we would like to add a few points to make a conclusion.
Clustering and PCA method works well in market segmentation. This output
can help NutrientH20 better target its audience and focus their social
media marketing efforts on a more defined and targeted group of people.

Question 3: Association rules for grocery purchases
===================================================

For the given data set, we first examine the distribution of items
bought. From the graph below, the most popular good is whole milk,
followed by other vegetables, rolls and buns, soda then yogurt.

![](case%20studies%20pic/basic_distribution-1.png)

We start by looping over support ranging from 0.009 to 0.05 and
confidence from 0.2 to 0.5. For these different combinations, we look
for the one giving us the maximum average lift. It means that there is a
high association between the items in the basket. Our goal is to get a
high lift value with maximum support.

    ##      sup  con avg_inspection
    ## 27 0.019 0.45       2.014596
    ## 32 0.019 0.50       2.007235
    ## 22 0.019 0.40       1.863106
    ## 28 0.029 0.45       1.850203
    ## 23 0.029 0.40       1.793654
    ## 24 0.039 0.40       1.787991
    ## 17 0.019 0.35       1.767332
    ## 19 0.039 0.35       1.733120
    ## 12 0.019 0.30       1.730407
    ## 7  0.019 0.25       1.711049

The results we get are best for support = 0.009 and confidence = 0.5
with a max average lift of 2.2255. Nevertheless, increasing the support
will ensure higher transactions containing items of interest. The trade
off here could be the decrease in lift, which what we see here. But, a
slightly higher support ensures many more transactions/rules with a
minimum effect on lift. Thus, we decide to choose support to be 0.01 and
confidence to be 0.4.

After picking values for support and confidence, we rerun the apriori.
We subset only rules whose lifts are larger than 2 because the mean is
very close to 2, we can eliminate weakly associated rules as well. This
gives us a set of 29 strongly associated rules. From the sample, whole
milk appeares the most followed by other vegetables. A large percent of
people with various baskets are almost always interested in buying whole
milk and/or other vegetables.

The graph gives us a depiction of the importance of the various basket
items. Whole milk and other vegetables appear to be the most common
items are in the middle with branches extending outwards to other items.

The next one gives us a two-key plot, not for only the subset but the
whole set of values as a function of support and confidence.

    subrules <- sample(subset_groc, 20)
    plot(subset_groc, method="matrix", measure="lift", control=list(reorder='support/confidence'))

    ## Itemsets in Antecedent (LHS)
    ##  [1] "{root vegetables}"                "{whipped/sour cream}"            
    ##  [3] "{root vegetables,whole milk}"     "{other vegetables,yogurt}"       
    ##  [5] "{chicken}"                        "{tropical fruit,whole milk}"

    ## [17] "{domestic eggs,whole milk}"       "{root vegetables,tropical fruit}"
    ## [19] "{butter,other vegetables}"        "{butter,whole milk}"

    ## [23] "{pork,whole milk}"                "{curd,yogurt}"                   
    ## Itemsets in Consequent (RHS)
    ## [1] "{other vegetables}" "{whole milk}"

![](case%20studies%20pic/matrix_rules-1.png)

    plot(subrules, method="graph", control=list(layout=igraph::in_circle()))

![](case%20studies%20pic/matrix_rules-2.png)

The final graphs are a matrix representation of the matrix of rules with
the color scale showing the lift. We can match the matrix to the lift
values above and get the exact items in the basket.

Hence, these visualizations depict the strength of the associations.
